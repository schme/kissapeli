# Kissapeli
OpenGL Pong clone for Windows.

I've made short video [clips](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmhCznL0nyhnzxuCDe5kqdWxupllLhl9G) throughout the making of the game.

## Compiling
When compiling from scratch you need to have the last DirectSDK version of XAudio2, not the Windows8 version currently shipping on Windows7 and others. Familiarize yourself with the makefile.
